This project implements a numerical verification of Ito’s Lemma by simulating Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to demonstrate how discrete price paths converge to theoretical stochastic outcomes. By modeling an asset price $S_t$ following $dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t$, the code proves that the log-price transformation $f(S) = \ln(S)$ yields the essential drift-correction term $(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)$ required for accurate derivative pricing.The repository is structured to separate the technical implementation in src/simulation.py from the formal mathematical theory found in docs/math_proof.pdf. This simulation utilizes a high-resolution time step ($dt = 0.001$) and standard equity parameters—such as a 5% drift and 20% volatility—to ensure numerical stability and realistic market behavior. To replicate these results, simply install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt via pip install -r requirements.txt and execute the script using python src/simulation.py.This comparison between the Euler-Maruyama discretized path and the Ito-predicted analytical solution serves as a fundamental building block for more complex quantitative models, such as path-dependent option pricing or risk management frameworks.
